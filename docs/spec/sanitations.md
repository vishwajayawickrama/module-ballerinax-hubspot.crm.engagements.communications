# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the official OpenAPI specification from HubSpot CRM Communications.
The OpenAPI specification is obtained from [Hubspot Github Public API Spec Collection](https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-public-api-spec-collection/blob/main/PublicApiSpecs/CRM/Feedback%20Submissions/Rollouts/424/v3/feedbackSubmissions.json).
These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.

1. Change the `url` property of the servers object

- **Original**: `https://api.hubspot.com`
- **Updated**: `https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/communications`
- **Reason**: This change of adding the common prefix `/crm/v3/objects/communications` to the base url makes it easier to access endpoints using the client.

2. Update the API Paths

- **Original**: Paths included common prefix above in each endpoint. (eg: `/crm/v3/objects/communications`)
- **Updated**: Common prefix is now removed from the endpoints as it is included in the base URL.

  - **Original**: `/crm/v3/objects/communications/batch/read`
  - **Updated**: `/batch/read`
- **Reason**:  This change simplifies the API paths, making them shorter and more readable.

## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.json -o ballerina --mode client --license docs/license.txt
```

Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2025, change if necessary.
